Purpose: Read the ID of a RFID card/tag
Notes: One library needs to be installed prior to running code:
Look for [mfrc522.py]and save to Raspberry Pi.
You can run this code to get the ID numbers of the RFID cards you are using, and then edit the code to suit your needs.
'''

from mfrc522 import MFRC522
import utime    #utime is a library that controlls the sleep function that happens at the end of the code.
import neopixel

reader = MFRC522(spi_id=0,sck=2,miso=4,mosi=3,cs=1,rst=0)
n = 58 #Number of LED pixels on strip
p = 15 #Pin that the LED is connected to on the Pi Pico

np = neopixel.NeoPixel(machine.Pin(p), n)

'''
IMPORTANT - MATCH THESE TO YOUR WIRING:
- sck=2   means the clock pin (SCK) is connected to GP2 on your Pico
- miso=4  means MISO is connected to GP4
- mosi=3  means MOSI is connected to GP3
- cs=1    means CS (chip select/SDA) is connected to GP1
- rst=0   means RST (reset) is connected to GP0

If your wiring is different, change the numbers above to match YOUR setup!
Example: If you connected RST to GP5 instead, change rst=0 to rst=5

    (stat, tag_type) = reader.request(reader.REQIDL)          # Ask "Is there an RFID tag nearby?"

# TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT: Replace the print() above with your own code!
            # Examples:
            # - Turn on an LED: led.value(1)
            # - Play a sound
            # - Count how many times this card has been scanned
            # - Check if this card number matches a specific allowed card

utime.sleep_ms(500) #take a .5 second delay
